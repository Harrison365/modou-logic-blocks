# Round 1

## Your mission should you choose to accept it...

Do you remember the way mobile keyboards used to work before touch screens?
The agonizing repeat button presses you needed to type every letter?

Well, here you have to calculate how many keystrokes (or button presses) you have to do for a specific word.

This is the layout we'll be working with:

_also known as a T9 keyboard, for text on 9 keys_

Your function will take in _one argument_, a word. It's your job to use this input to output the number of keystrokes it will take to type this word into your grandma's nokia 3310!

Hop into mobileKeystrokes.js to get going!
